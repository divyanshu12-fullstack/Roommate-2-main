This code creates a simple Express.js server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello from Express!" to any
GET request to the root path (`/`). It also includes error handling for port binding failures.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Define a route handler for the root path ('/')
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

// Start the server and handle potential errors
app.listen(port, (err) => {
if (err) {
console.error('Error starting server:', err);
return;
}
console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

To run this code:

1. **Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.** You can download them from
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Create a new directory** for your project.

3. **Create a file named `server.js` (or any name you prefer with a `.js` extension) and paste the code into it.**

4. **Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `server.js`, and run the command:** `npm install express`
This will install the Express.js library.

5. **Then, run:** `node server.js`

You should see the message "Server listening on port 3000" in your terminal. You can then access the server by visiting
`http://localhost:3000` in your web browser. You'll see the message "Hello from Express!".


This is a basic example. For more complex applications, you'll want to add more routes, middleware (functions that
execute before route handlers), and potentially use a template engine for dynamic content. Let me know if you'd like to
explore any of those features!
